abstract = {To investigate a potential contribution of systemic physiology to recently reported BOLD fMRI signals in white matter, we compared photo-plethysmography (PPG) and whole-brain fMRI signals recorded simultaneously during long resting-state scans from an overnight sleep study. We found that intermittent drops in the amplitude of the PPG signal exhibited strong and widespread correlations with the fMRI signal, both in white matter (WM) and in gray matter (GM). The WM signal pattern resembled that seen in previous resting-state fMRI studies and closely tracked the location of medullary veins. Its temporal cross-correlation with the PPG amplitude was bipolar, with an early negative value. In GM, the correlation was consistently positive. Consistent with previous studies comparing physiological signals with fMRI, these findings point to a systemic vascular contribution to WM fMRI signals. The PPG drops are interpreted as systemic vasoconstrictive events, possibly related to intermittent increases in sympathetic tone related to fluctuations in arousal state. The counter-intuitive polarity of the WM signal is explained by long blood transit times in the medullary vasculature of WM, which cause blood oxygenation loss and a substantial timing mismatch between blood volume and blood oxygenation effects. A similar mechanism may explain previous findings of negative WM signals around large draining veins during both task- and resting-state fMRI.},

abstract = {Changes in brain activity accompanying shifts in vigilance and arousal can interfere with the study of other intrinsic and task-evoked characteristics of brain function. However, the difficulty of tracking and modeling the arousal state during functional MRI (fMRI) typically precludes the assessment of arousal-dependent influences on fMRI signals. Here we combine fMRI, electrophysiology, and the monitoring of eyelid behavior to demonstrate an approach for tracking continuous variations in arousal level from fMRI data. We first characterize the spatial distribution of fMRI signal fluctuations that track a measure of behavioral arousal; taking this pattern as a template, and using the local field potential as a simultaneous and independent measure of cortical activity, we observe that the time-varying expression level of this template in fMRI data provides a close approximation of electrophysiological arousal. We discuss the potential benefit of these findings for increasing the sensitivity of fMRI as a cognitive and clinical biomarker.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Mandelkow, de Zwart and Duyn.Naturalistic stimuli like movies evoke complex perceptual processes, which are of great interest in the study of human cognition by functional MRI (fMRI). However, conventional fMRI analysis based on statistical parametric mapping (SPM) and the general linear model (GLM) is hampered by a lack of accurate parametric models of the BOLD response to complex stimuli. In this situation, statistical machine-learning methods, a.k.a. multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), have received growing attention for their ability to generate stimulus response models in a data-driven fashion. However, machine-learning methods typically require large amounts of training data as well as computational resources. In the past, this has largely limited their application to fMRI experiments involving small sets of stimulus categories and small regions of interest in the brain. By contrast, the present study compares several classification algorithms known as Nearest Neighbor (NN), Gaussian Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes (GNB), and (regularized) Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) in terms of their classification accuracy in discriminating the global fMRI response patterns evoked by a large number of naturalistic visual stimuli presented as a movie. Results show that LDA regularized by principal component analysis (PCA) achieved high classification accuracies, above 90{\%} on average for single fMRI volumes acquired 2 s apart during a 300 s movie (chance level 0.7{\%} = 2s/300s). The largest source of classification errors were autocorrelations in the BOLD signal compounded by the similarity of consecutive stimuli. All classifiers performed best when given input features from a large region of interest comprising around 25{\%} of the voxels that responded significantly to the visual stimulus. Consistent with this, the most informative principal components represented widespread distributions of co-activated brain regions that were similar between subjects and may represent functional networks. In light of these results, the combination of naturalistic movie stimuli and classification analysis in fMRI experiments may prove to be a sensitive tool for the assessment of changes in natural cognitive processes under experimental manipulation.},

Specifically, our experiment is designed to localize the current source of alpha waves by analyzing the spectral coherence of EEG channel and MRI voxel time series recorded simultaneously in human subjects. A phantom containing a dipolar current source was constructed to determine the sensitivity of the measurement and to validate the analytical approach. The analysis of our in-vivo and in-vitro data indicates that a moderate improvement in SNR may render alpha waves detectable by this kind of correlation analysis, but the specificity of any such approach may be limited due to physiological confounds like cardiac pulsation.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Recent MRI studies have suggested that the magnetic susceptibility of white matter (WM) in the human brain is anisotropic, providing a new contrast mechanism for the visualization of fiber bundles and allowing the extraction of cellular compartment-specific information. This study provides an independent confirmation and quantification of this anisotropy. METHODS: Anisotropic magnetic susceptibility results in a torque exerted on WM when placed in a uniform magnetic field, tending to align the WM fibers with the field. To quantify the effect, excised spinal cord samples were placed in a torque balance inside the magnet of a 7 T MRI system and the magnetic torque was measured as function of orientation. RESULTS: All tissue samples (n = 5) showed orienting effects, confirming the presence of anisotropic susceptibility. Analysis of the magnetic torque resulted in reproducible values for the WM volume anisotropy that ranged from 13.6 to 19.2 ppb. CONCLUSION: The independently determined anisotropy values confirm estimates inferred from MRI experiments and validate the use of anisotropy to extract novel information about brain fiber structure and myelination.

We demonstrate the use of a commercially available frequency divider and phase-locking device for the purpose of synchronizing an MRI acquisition with a simultaneous recording of the EEG. Synchronization hugely improves the effectiveness of MRI artefact removal from the EEG signal by the common mean template subtraction method. It complements or substitutes post-processing techniques like filtering, thereby increasing the usable bandwidth of the EEG signal to about 150 Hz. This is important for covering the full range of human Gamma band activity. Similarly, synchronization eliminates the necessity for over-sampling of the EEG signal.},

abstract = {It has been suggested recently that the influence of the neuro-magnetic field should make electrical brain activity directly detectable by MRI. To test this hypothesis, we performed combined EEG-MRI experiments which aim to localize the neuronal current sources of alpha waves (8-12 Hz), one of the most prominent EEG phenomena in humans. A detailed analysis of cross-spectral coherence between simultaneously recorded EEG and MRI time series revealed no sign of alpha waves. Instead the EEG-MRI approach was found to be hampered by artefacts due to cardiac pulsation, which extend into the frequency band of alpha waves. Separate brain displacement mapping experiments confirmed that not only the EEG but also the MRI signal is confounded by harmonics of the cardiac frequency even at 10 Hz and beyond. This well-known ballistocardiogram artefact cannot be avoided or eliminated entirely by available signal processing techniques. Therefore we must conclude that current EEG-MRI methodology based on correlation analysis lacks not only the sensitivity but also the specificity required for the reliable detection of alpha waves.},

abstract = {The electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) inside the scanner is obstructed by the MRI gradient artefact (MGA) originating from the electromagnetic interference of the MRI with the sensitive measurement of electrical scalp potentials. Post-processing algorithms based on average artefact subtraction (AAS) have proven to be efficient in removing the MGA. However, the residual MGA after AAS still limits the quality and usable bandwidth of the EEG data despite further reduction through re-sampling, principal component analysis (PCA), and regressive filtering. We recently demonstrated that the residual MGA can largely be avoided by means of hardware synchronization. Here we present a new software synchronization method, which substitutes hardware synchronization and facilitates the removal of motion artefacts by PCA. The effectiveness of the retrospective synchronization algorithm (Resync) is demonstrated by comparison to the aforementioned techniques. For this purpose, we also developed a method for simulating the MGA and we propose new concepts for quantifying and comparing the performance of post-processing algorithms for EEG-MRI data. Results indicate that the benefits of (retrospective) synchronization and PCA depend largely on the relative contribution of timing errors and motion artefacts to the residual MGA as well as the frequency range of interest.},
